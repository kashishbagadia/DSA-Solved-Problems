# Length of Last Word
Given a string ```s``` consists of some words separated by spaces, *return the length of the last word in the string. If the last word does not exist, return* ```0```.

A **word** is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.
## Examples
```
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
```
```
Input: s = " "
Output: 0
```
## Contraints
* ```1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>```
* ```s``` consists of only English letters and spaces ```' '```.
