# Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
#### Given the ```root``` of a binary tree, return *its maximum depth*.

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Examples

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```
```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```
```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```
```
Input: root = [0]
Output: 1
```
## Contraints
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10<sup>4</sup>].
* ```-100 <= Node.val <= 100```
