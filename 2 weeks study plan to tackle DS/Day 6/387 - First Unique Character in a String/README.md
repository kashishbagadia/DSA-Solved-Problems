# First Unique Character in a String
Given a string `s`, *find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index*. If it does not exist, return `-1`.
## Examples

```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
```
```
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2
```
```
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1
```
## Contraints
* 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
